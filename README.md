- Hi, I’m Trista (She/Her). An MA Philosophy graduate specialising in formal logic, especially the logical analysis of natural language.
- I'm good at learning formal languages quickly, and at translating them into natural language and vice versa. 
- I have experience with python, and am always trying to learn more.
