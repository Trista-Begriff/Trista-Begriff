- Hi, I’m Trista (She/Her). An MA Philosophy graduate based in York, specialising in formal logic, especially the logical analysis of natural language.
- I pick up formal languages quickly, and am proficient at translating them into natural language and vice versa. 
- I have experience with python, and am always trying to learn more.
- I'm currently looking for work as either a software engineer, software tester, or data analyst.
